General: 

5 days entrainment (12/12 all simulations), 1 day observation 

set entrainment_cycles = 5;



To trigger gene knockout: 
	- set kinetic rate (variable p) of gene to knockout to very low value
	
To change Light Dark condition to LL,DD,LD
	- controlled by variable _[LD|LL|DD]_observation, set one of them to 1 to enable
	- for DD make sure to set the entrainment_cycles a little down so that the spike after entrainment disappears
	   I've used 4.9 for it  


Samples taken every 6 minutes -> 144 samples/day, total 1440 samples

Components: 20 mRNAs and Proteins + light; GI.ZTL and ZTL are included but can/should be excluded when scaling.


Data WT:

     on 6th day: LL, LD, DD 

     set one of these, e.g LD (12/12) is enabled: 
     _DD_observation = 0;
     _LL_observation = 0;
     _LD_observation = 1;

Data WT_photoperiod:

     on 6th day: varying photoperiod

     set '_LD_observation = 1;' (for LD)

     and 'dusk_observation = [4|6|8|18];'

Data Knockout:

     on 6th day: no change, same 12/12 LD as entrainment (i.e. dusk_observation = 12 )

     knockouts: LHY/CCA1  - p1 & p2 = 0.0001
     	PPR7,PPR9 - p8 & p9 = 0.0001
		TOC1      - p4 = 0.0001
		GI        - p11 = 0.0001
